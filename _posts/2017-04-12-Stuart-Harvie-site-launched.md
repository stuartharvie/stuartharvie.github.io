Hello,

I am currently in the process of studying for an MSc Information Systems Development at Napier University. As part of this course, I have developed a passion for learning about web design and development so I'll mainly be using this site to document my journey in 
learning web development from the bottom up.

I have finally got around to putting this website together. Cool thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be and looking forward to exploring it further.

Stuart
