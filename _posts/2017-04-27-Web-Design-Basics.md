<p>Since I started exploring the topic of web development, something which I have found challenging is considering the actual design of a website. While undertaking simple practice projects I have found that I am not spending as much time as I should be planning out the design of a site before starting to code it. So it is about time that I changed my ways.</p>

<p>From the various sources I have consulted so far, I think I have narrowed some key components to designing a website:</p>

<p>Topography: Limit the font used to a maximum of 3, but ideally less. Any more can cause the page to look messy. Relevant fonts should also be chosen which reflect the look and feel you want for the website. Serif fonts are for headlines as they become difficult to read at smaller sizes therefore stick to sans-serif fonts for body text.</p>

<p>Colors and images: Limit the colour scheme to 2 or 3. The primary colour should be consistent with branding and the call to action colour should be complimentary. You should also take colour blindness into consideration when choosing colour combinations and take care when choosing images. Avoid images that move and only choose relevant images that convey key information or message. It is also important to ensure images are optimised and sizes are as low as possible. A useful tool I stumbled upon is Optimizilla (http://optimizilla.com/) which allows you to reduce image size efficiently.</p>

<p>Spacing and Layout: Visual hierarchy is paramount. Most people read left-to-right from top-to-bottom therefore ensure that important elements like a logo, call to actions or an important image are placed strategically. You should also utilise white space when required. This means getting rid of things that donâ€™t contribute to the overall message and image that the webpage is portraying.</p>

<p>While this is a fairly simple list and some appear obvious, I thought it was important to make a note to my future self about the importance of a user-friendly experience which is something I have tried to achieve with my personal website.</p>
